This project aims to enhance urban transportation planning by developing and comparing various models for predicting traffic flow at different junctions. Using historical traffic data, we apply exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and diverse predictive models, including ARIMA, XGBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and hybrid models combining ARIMA with XGBoost and LSTM networks. The models are evaluated using RMSE, providing insights into their effectiveness.
